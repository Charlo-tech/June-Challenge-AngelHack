# Creepto3 - A Crypto Sharing dApp by Team Desarades(Ruita_Wachira & Diana_Mwithalii)

## Project Overview
### WHAT:
Creepto3 is a crypto sharing dApp that uses Metamask and Solidity for web3 contracts powered by [Thirdweb](https://thirdweb.com). It also shares crypto news on the platform.
### WHO: 
The app is for everyone and anyone who may want to move decentralized assets across and all over the world. Moreover, it caters for blockchain users and crypto traders.
### WHY: 
The inspiration for the app crops up from the need to solve the problem that has arose due to the increased crypto assets. The app aims to solve the problem of crypto asset transfer. This solution is achieved through the app as it allows its users to transfer crypto assets from one user to another or from one place to another.

## Description of the Technologies and Tools used

### 1. React
React is a JavaScript library used to create responsive UIs using reusable components. It is used to build single page applications. It is also used to handle the view layer for web and mobile apps. It is currently one of the most popular JavaScript libraries and has a strong foundation and large community behind it.

```bash
npm install react
```

### 2. Solidity
Solidity is a programming language used to write smart contracts that run on the Ethereum Virtual Machine on blockchains. It is a contract-oriented, high-level language whose syntax is similar to that of JavaScript and it is designed to target the Ethereum Virtual Machine.

### 3. Web3
Web3 is a collection of libraries that allow you to interact with a local or remote Ethereum node using HTTP or IPC connection. It is used to interact with the Ethereum blockchain and allows you to read from and write to the blockchain.

### 4. Thirdweb
Thirdweb is a framework to build decentralized applications. It is installed on the command line using npm. It is used to build decentralized applications that run on the Ethereum blockchain. It is built on top of React and uses Solidity for smart contracts.

```bash
npm i @thirdweb-dev/react @thirdweb-dev/sdk ethers@^5
```

### 5. Metamask
Metamask is a cryptocurrency wallet that allows users to interact with the Ethereum blockchain. It is a browser extension that allows users to run Ethereum dApps right in their browser without running a full Ethereum node. It also allows users to store and manage their private keys.

### 6. Netlify
Netlify is a cloud computing company that offers hosting and serverless backend services for web applications and static websites. It is used to host the Creepto3 dApp.


### 7. Vite
Vite is a build tool that is used to build Quickly deployable React applications.

```bash
npm install -g create-vite-app
```

## Setup and Installation Instructions
Creepto3 runs entirely on the web hence no setup or installation needed. The only requirement is for the user to have a wallet extension installed on their browser such as Metamask or Coinbase Wallet.


## Challenges
Getting the smart contracts to work properly was a steep learning curve.


## Future Plans
We intend to add NFT trading as Thirdweb already has that provision in their framework. Adding a crypto market tracker is also a future plan.
